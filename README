BibtexMaker is supposed to help you creating a BibTex document for an already
written document. It parses all citations and creates a new BibTex file with
all the referenced citations. Then you have to fill out all the elements in the
resulting document and should be ready to use it in your LaTeX document.

$ ./bibtexMaker.py -h
usage: bibtexMaker.py [-h] [-o OUTFILE] FILE [FILE ...]

optional arguments:

  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        output file for the bibtex (default: bibtex.bib)
