BibtexMaker is supposed to help you creating a Bibtex document for an already
written document. It parses all citations and creates a new Bibtex file with
all the referenced citations. Then you have to fill out all the elements in the
resulting document and should be ready to use it in your LaTeX document.

$ ./bibtexMaker.py -h
usage: bibtexMaker.py [-h] [-o OUTFILE] [-b BIBS] [-t CITETYPE]
                      FILE [FILE ...]

positional arguments:
  FILE                  LaTeX files to parse for citations

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        output file for the bibtex (default: bibtex.bib)
  -b BIBS, --bib BIBS   bib files to check for already defined references
  -t CITETYPE, --type CITETYPE
